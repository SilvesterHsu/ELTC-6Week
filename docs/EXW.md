# Paraphrasing and Summarizing

!!! tip "Learning Outcomes"
    * Construct appropriate paraphrases and summaries of a source text using different techniques.
    * Avoid plagiarism based on the above.
    * Evaluate the quality of a paraphrase.

In academic writing, you must be able to understand information from a source text and use it to support your view/argument.
    
* Paraphrasing is writing the ideas of another person in your own words.
* A summary is a shortened version of a text written by another person. It contains the main points in the text and is written in your own words (paraphrase).
* A quotation or quote is an exact copy of a short piece of text written by another person. It is used to support your ideas/statements in your writing. Use sparingly: your writing should be mainly your own words.
* All three require citation.
