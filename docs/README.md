# Coding strategy

1.  All code is coded by Markdown, please comply with the following Markdown.
2.  The set of code is automatically executed by the Travis script, and the generated HTML is automatically stored in the **gh-pages** branch. **Do not delete the branch!!!**

# Basic Markdown Roles

See the [Typora's Markdown Tutorial](https://support.typora.io/Markdown-Reference).

Additionally, our document also support **Note**, [here](https://silvesterhsu.github.io/Mkdocs/Extensions/) to see further details.

## Block Elements

### Paragraph and line breaks

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text. In markdown source code, paragraphs are separated by two or more blank lines. In Typora, you only need one blank line (press `Return` once) to create a new paragraph.

Press `Shift` + `Return` to create a single line break. Most other markdown parsers will ignore single line breaks, so in order to make other markdown parsers recognize your line break, you can leave two spaces at the end of the line, or insert `<br/>`.

### Headers

Headers use 1-6 hash (`#`) characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:

```
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
```

### Blockquotes

Markdown uses email-style `>` and a space ` ` characters for block quoting. They are presented as:

```
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. This is first paragraph.
>
> This is second pragraph. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.



> This is another blockquote with one paragraph. There is three empty line to seperate two blockquote.
```

### Lists

Input `* list item 1` will create an unordered list.

Input `1. list item 1` will create an ordered list.

```
## un-ordered list
*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue

## ordered list
1.  Red
2. 	Green
3.	Blue
```

### Task List

Task lists are lists with items marked as either [ ] or [x] (incomplete or complete). For example:

```
- [ ] a task list item
- [ ] list syntax required
- [ ] normal **formatting**, @mentions, #1234 refs
- [ ] incomplete
- [x] completed
```

You can change the complete/incomplete state by clicking on the checkbox before the item.

### Tables

Input `| First Header | Second Header |` and press the `return` key. 

In markdown source code, they look like:

```
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

You can also include inline Markdown such as links, bold, italics, or strikethrough in the table.

Finally, by including colons (`:`) within the header row, you can define text in that column to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

```
| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |
```

A colon on the left-most side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the right-most side indicates a right-aligned column; a colon on both sides indicates a center-aligned column.

## Span Elements

Span elements will be parsed and rendered right after typing. Moving the cursor in middle of those span elements will expand those elements into markdown source. Below is an explanation of the syntax for each span element.

### Links

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link textâ€™s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

```
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
```

will produce:

This is [an example](http://example.com/"Title") inline link. 

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute. 

### Images

Images have similar syntax as links, but they require an additional `!` char before the start of the link. The syntax for inserting an image looks like this:

```
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
```

### Strong

A double `*` or `_` will cause its enclosed contents to be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>` tag, e.g:

```
**double asterisks**

__double underscores__
```

output:

**double asterisks**

**double underscores**

It is recommended to  use the `**` symbol.

### Code

To indicate an inline span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:

```
Use the `printf()` function.
```

will produce:

Use the `printf()` function.

### Strikethrough

GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.

`~~Mistaken text.~~` becomes ~~Mistaken text.~~

### Underlines

Underline is powered by raw HTML.

`<u>Underline</u>` becomes <u>Underline</u>.
