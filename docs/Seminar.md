# Introduction
One of the assessment tasks on this course is a seminar based on a lecture. In it you will

*   Need to prepare questions to ask other students
*   Discuss questions set by other students
*   Discuss questions set by ELTC (usually 4 or 5 questions)

!!! tip "Cautions"
    *   You will not usually see the question set by ELTC in advance - they are unseen questions that you must discuss spontaneously.
    *   You can think about what you want to say in answer to your partners' questions.
    *   Do not script your answers.<br>
        *Reading from a prepared script is not 'discussing'. When it comes to an assessment, reading from a script sounds unnatural. It is more natural to  listen to the question and the responses the other students give and respond to them. This is the way to get a better mark, and to improve your listening and speaking skills.*
    *   You wll have a mock seminar and a practice before the final seminar.
    *   Video of the lecture will be released at 11:15 on the same of your seminar. Usually there are only 2 hours to preparation & lunch (Please avoid speaking on an empty stomach. Show the energy of your voice!).
    *   Lectures usually have slides. 

# Notes Taking

Two styles of notes are introduced in class - linear notes & spider diagrams. 

!!! tip "Elements of Good Notes"
    *   use symbols/ abbreviations
    *   are easy to understand later
    *   contain main points
    *   show the organisation of ideas (use headings/sub-headings)(e.g. noun phrases)
    *   can be used to produce a summary from
 
!!! tip "Tips on Listening"
    *   Pay attention to **pauses** and **intonation**
    
        *   Speech is divided into sections with pauses.
        *   Pauses are like punctuation.
        *   Intonation is used to give meaning.
        *   The intonation of statements tends to rise and then fall.
        *   Understanding these points can help with both listening and speaking.<br><br>
    
    
    *   Pay attention to **signposts**<br>
        e.g. *"just to summarize", "so we are going to look at", etc.*

# Points about Evaluating Seminars in General

Think about the different stages we discussed when conducting a seminar.

Discuss / check whether your group performed these things, if not think about why and if you did perform them how well. 

<u>**Before**</u>

*   Meet with members in your groups; divide the research.
*   Prepare well for the task, with annotations of the reading and/or notes.
*   Ensure a good understanding of the text/topic, discussing both the main ideas and some supporting points.
*   Meet again; plan who will present each part.
*   Do some detailed/analytical reading, note-taking and summarising.
*   Think about your stance in relation to the topic.
*   Adopt a stance which is evaluative, analytical or critical.
*   Make a plan to read from; do not write down everything you are going to say, but make points you can refer to easily.
*   You could also make some handouts for other students.
*   Practice presenting your part to other people a day or so before the seminar, and get their feedback.
 
<u>**During**</u>

*   Speak clearly and confidently.
*   Look at your tutor and other students as much as possible.
*   When listening to others, do not interrupt while they are speaking.
*   During this time take notes in the same way you would in a lecture.
*   Look out for signals when it is time to ask questions or start the debate.
*   Once the debate starts, it is very important to contribute.
*   Make sure your discussion is focused and informed.
*   Sometimes you might be asked a direct question by a tutor or others in group.
*   It is fine to disagree, but be polite and give your opinion without sounding like you are arguing.
*   Do not worry if you do not like speaking in public.

<u>**After**</u>

*   Type up and file any notes you have made during the seminar.
*   You could also meet up with other students to chat about what was discussed afterwards.
