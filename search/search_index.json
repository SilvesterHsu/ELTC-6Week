In it you will Need to prepare questions to ask other students Discuss questions set by other students Discuss questions set by ELTC (usually 4 or 5 questions) Cautions You will not usually see the question set by ELTC in advance - they are unseen questions that you must discuss spontaneously. You can think about what you want to say in answer to your partners' questions. Do not script your answers. Reading from a prepared script is not 'discussing'. When it comes to an assessment, reading from a script sounds unnatural. It is more natural to listen to the question and the responses the other students give and respond to them. This is the way to get a better mark, and to improve your listening and speaking skills. You wll have a mock seminar and a practice before the final seminar. Video of the lecture will be released at 11:15 on the same of your seminar. Usually there are only 2 hours to preparation & lunch (Please avoid speaking on an empty stomach. Show the energy of your voice!). Lectures usually have slides. Notes Taking \u00b6 Two styles of notes are introduced in class - linear notes & spider diagrams. Elements of Good Notes use symbols/ abbreviations are easy to understand later contain main points show the organisation of ideas (use headings/sub-headings)(e.g. noun phrases) can be used to produce a summary from Tips on Listening Pay attention to pauses and intonation Speech is divided into sections with pauses. Pauses are like punctuation. Intonation is used to give meaning. The intonation of statements tends to rise and then fall. Understanding these points can help with both listening and speaking. Pay attention to signposts e.g. \"just to summarize\", \"so we are going to look at\", etc. Qusetions Classification \u00b6 3Rs \u00b6 Review Response Reflect Points about Evaluating Seminars in General \u00b6 Think about the different stages we discussed when conducting a seminar. Discuss / check whether your group performed these things, if not think about why and if you did perform them how well. Before Meet with members in your groups; divide the research. Prepare well for the task, with annotations of the reading and/or notes. Ensure a good understanding of the text/topic, discussing both the main ideas and some supporting points. Meet again; plan who will present each part. Do some detailed/analytical reading, note-taking and summarising. Think about your stance in relation to the topic. Adopt a stance which is evaluative, analytical or critical. Make a plan to read from; do not write down everything you are going to say, but make points you can refer to easily. You could also make some handouts for other students. Practice presenting your part to other people a day or so before the seminar, and get their feedback. During Speak clearly and confidently. Look at your tutor and other students as much as possible. When listening to others, do not interrupt while they are speaking. During this time take notes in the same way you would in a lecture. Look out for signals when it is time to ask questions or start the debate. Once the debate starts, it is very important to contribute. Make sure your discussion is focused and informed. Sometimes you might be asked a direct question by a tutor or others in group. It is fine to disagree, but be polite and give your opinion without sounding like you are arguing. Do not worry if you do not like speaking in public. After Type up and file any notes you have made during the seminar. You could also meet up with other students to chat about what was discussed afterwards. Useful Language for Seminar Discussions \u00b6 Giving an Opinion I think that... I don't think that...
